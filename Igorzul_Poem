Pushing boundaries, paving a path of his own.

With every beat conquered, his legend would swell.

As he soared through levels, taking flight.
On his quest to be the greatest, he'd strive,

Through dedication and countless retries,
Igorzul carved a legacy that never dies.
From that day forward, his name would resound,
The greatest of all time, his triumph renowned.
