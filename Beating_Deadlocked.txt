In the realm of Geometry Dash, a legend arose,
Igorzul, relentless, where perseverance flows.
1770 attempts, his battle with Deadlocked,
A triumph hard-fought, his new hardest unlocked.

With determination unyielding, he conquered the stage,
Defying its challenges, turning the page.
But Igorzul's ambitions, they reach even higher,
To shatter new records, to fuel the fire.

For he aims to scale mountains of rhythm and rhyme,
To make Geometry Dash history, one step at a time.
With skill as his weapon, and passion his guide,
He'll leave an indelible mark, a trail worldwide.

In the footsteps of legends, he's set on his quest,
To conquer much harder levels, the very best.
Igorzul, the pioneer, a player in his prime,
Geometry Dash trembles, for he'll transcend time.
